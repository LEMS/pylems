### Installation

A stable version of PyLEMS is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyLEMS) using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html):

```
pip install pylems
```

Alternatively, you can obtain the latest version with

```
git clone https://github.com/LEMS/pylems.git
cd pylems
git checkout development   # optional
pip install .
```

### Usage as a LEMS model simulator

```
pylems [options] LEMS_file
```

**Options**

- -I/-include path - Adds a directory to the model file include search path

### Examples

**NeuroML examples (from https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/tree/development/NeuroML2CoreTypes)**

- Example 0 --  Working
- Example 1 --  Working
- Example 2 --  Working
- Example 3 --  Working
- Example 4 --  Not working (Unsupported in PyLEMS: KSChannel)
- Example 5 --  Working
- Example 6 --  Working
- Example 7 --  Working

**LEMS examples (in directory examples)**

- example1.xml --  Working
- example2.xml --  Working
- example3.xml --  Working
- example4.xml --  Not working (Unsupported in PyLEMS: KSChannel)
- example5.xml --  Not working (Unsupported in PyLEMS: KSChannel)
- example6.xml --  Working

TODO: Rest of examples require an update to the `<Simulation>` element, i.e. use `<Simulation...>` not `<SimulationSet...>`, to work in PyLEMS

**LEMS elements that do not work**

- KSChannel
- Property
- XPath based parameters - PathParameter
- Assertions

**Tasks TODO**

- Implement flattening
- Decouple events from runnables
- Improve dimension-checking on expressions.
